## About The Project

**Nebula AUSP (Adaptive Universal System Profiler)** is a cutting-edge benchmarking tool designed for the modern web. It moves beyond simple FPS counters to run a **gauntlet of specialized tests** that isolate and measure the performance of key system components, including the CPU, GPU, and memory bandwidth.

The core philosophy is **adaptive testing**. Nebula intelligently detects your system's capabilities to run a tailored set of tests. This ensures that any deviceâ€”from a low-power laptop to a high-end gaming rigâ€”can receive a meaningful and comparable score, creating a fair and competitive platform for all users.

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive "Gauntlet" Benchmark:** A multi-stage test that analyzes various aspects of your system:
    *   **Max-Q Search:** Automatically finds the maximum particle workload your system can sustain at a target FPS.
    *   **GPU Stress Test:** Isolates fragment shader and fill-rate performance.
    *   **CPU Stress Test:** Measures raw computation and physics simulation performance.
    *   **Combined Load Test:** Measures performance under a realistic, mixed workload.
*   **Advanced Physics Simulation:** A multi-threaded physics engine simulates hundreds of thousands of particles, interacting with a central black hole and an orbiting moon.
*   **Rich Visuals:** Rendered with Three.js, the scene features a procedural accretion disk, polar jets, and a multi-layered nebula, all running in real-time.
*   **Live Diagnostics:** An on-screen panel provides real-time insight into FPS, particle counts, and benchmark progress.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Vite.js, modular JavaScript, and a Web Worker architecture for maximum performance and maintainability.

## Tech Stack

*   [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) - 3D Rendering
*   [**Vite.js**](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling
*   **Web Workers** - Multi-threaded Physics
*   **Express.js** - Leaderboard Backend
*   **gh-pages** - Deployment

## Development Roadmap

Our progress is tracked in phases. See the [open issues](https://github.com/MadGoatHaz/nebula-ausp/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known bugs).

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Benchmark
- [x] **Project Restructuring:** Migrate to a modern, modular Vite.js structure.
- [x] **Capability Scan:** Detect system capabilities on startup.
- [x] **"Gauntlet" Implementation:** Build the multi-stage benchmark process.
- [x] **Scoring Algorithm v1.0:** Implement a composite scoring algorithm.

### ðŸ”³ Phase 2: Leaderboard & Data
- [ ] **System Info Collector:** Gather detailed (but privacy-respecting) hardware information.
- [ ] **Backend API:** Develop a service to receive and store benchmark submissions.
- [ ] **Database:** Set up a database to store scores and system information.
- [ ] **Submission UI:** Implement a "Submit Score" feature in the application.
- [ ] **Leaderboard UI:** Create a public-facing leaderboard page.

### ðŸ”³ Phase 3: Advanced Tests
- [ ] **WASM/SIMD Physics:** Develop a hyper-optimized physics loop in Rust or C++.
- [ ] **WebGPU Compute:** Move the entire physics simulation to a WebGPU compute shader.
- [ ] **WebGPU Ray Tracing:** Create a new scene to test dedicated RT hardware.
