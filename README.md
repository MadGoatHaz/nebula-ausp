### **About The Project**
**Nebula AUSP (Adaptive Universal System Profiler)** is a cutting-edge benchmarking tool designed for the modern web. It moves beyond simple FPS counters to run a **gauntlet of specialized tests** that isolate and measure the performance of key system components, including the CPU, GPU, and memory bandwidth.

> The core philosophy is **adaptive testing**. Nebula intelligently detects your system's capabilities to run a tailored set of tests. This ensures that any deviceâ€”from a low-power laptop to a high-end gaming rigâ€”can receive a meaningful and comparable score, creating a fair and competitive platform for all users.

---

### **Key Features**
-   **Comprehensive "Gauntlet" Benchmark:** A multi-stage test that analyzes various aspects of your system, including a Max-Q Search, GPU Stress Test, and CPU Stress Test.
-   **Advanced Physics Simulation:** A multi-threaded physics engine simulates hundreds of thousands of particles interacting with a central black hole.
-   **Rich & Dynamic Visuals:** Rendered with Three.js, the scene features a procedural accretion disk, polar jets, and a multi-layered nebula, all running in real-time.
-   **Live Diagnostics:** An on-screen panel provides real-time insight into FPS, particle counts, and benchmark progress.
-   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Vite.js, modular JavaScript, and a Web Worker architecture for maximum performance and maintainability.
